## Introduction

So much of being a dungeon master for 5E is left up to interpretation. Outside of combat, the actual process for running the game is loose and ill-defined. There are rules for resolving actions, rules for encumbrance, rules for travel, rules for many individual parts of the game. However, there is no defined process for how to actually run the game. As a DM, what do you actually do? Do you need to track time? How would you do that, if you needed to? Do you need to play out every single thing, even mundane actions like walking down a safe hallway? If not, how do you choose what to play out? This was defined in older versions of the game, but not in 5E.

I think there is value in defining such processes. After years of running games, I have gradually settled on some processes that work for me, largely through reading blogs and forums and experimenting - not so much through the official rulebooks. However, to get to this point I had to experiment with a lot of really bad processes and fumble my way to understanding how running a tabletop roleplaying game actually works.

This is the first in a series of articles where I seek to define some common processes for running the game, as well as when to use those processes and how to transition between them. I hope to both give game masters some starting place in the shapeless void of running a game, and also to dig deeper into the various gameplay structures that are available. I hope that this is useful for other game masters who, like me, value well-defined game structures and consistently presenting players with interesting choices as part of the system, rather than through special effort.

The bulk of my current tabletop gaming is in 5th edition, and thus my writing will be generally focused there. However, many of these core gameplay structures and processes apply to other tabletop games as well.

## Game Worlds as Node Maps

To dig into the processes used when running a game, we must dig into how our game world is structured. At first glance, it doesn’t seem to have much structure. The game world is just a big blob of information, likely scattered across far too many documents and lodged into the recesses of your brain. However, imagining an entire world and everything within that world is a tall order. A person can only hold a certain amount of information in their head at once, so how could a GM possibly hold an entire world in their mind?

Luckily, most aspects of the world don’t actually matter when running a tabletop RPG. To break down that potentially infinite blob of information, game worlds, at least when in play, are treated as some number of nodes which are connected in defined ways. Each node is largely self-contained, limiting the amount of information that players and the GM need to understand at any one time in order to make sense of the game. While the events in one node can certainly affect other nodes in the world, they do so in limited ways which can be simply processed by the GM.

A room in a dungeon is a classic example of a node. It is self-contained, so the GM and players can focus only on the few interesting aspects of the room rather than the entire world. It also has very clear connections to other nodes: doors. The players will be in the node until they open a door and move to a different node. Once the players move to a different room, the contents of the first room can largely be put out of mind. This allows the amount of information in play to remain largely constant as the players explore a dungeon.

## Adventures as Node Maps

Just as locations in a world are typically organized as nodes, so too are adventures. A simple adventure structure, for example: A villager tells you a dragon has been terrorizing the village, and only the Sword of Dragonslaying can defeat it (Node 1). Gather the three parts of the Sword of Dragonslaying (Nodes 2 - 4), then slay the dragon (Node 5).

  <figcaption style="display:table-caption; caption-side:bottom; text-align:center;">Image 2. This adventure has 5 nodes, which intersects with our geographic node map.</figcaption>
</figure>

You’ll notice that this adventure node map intersects with the geographic node map. The blade is in a tomb, which is a node on our world map. The dragon likely lives in some kind of lair, which exists on the world map, and at an even more granular level the dragon likely lives within a specific room of a larger lair.

Node-based adventure design has been written about extensively by Justin Alexander. Their [articles on it](http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/7949/roleplaying-games/node-based-scenario-design-part-1-the-plotted-approach) are well worth reading.

## Layers of Nodes

Now that we’re thinking about the world in terms of nodes, it quickly becomes clear that there are multiple layers of nodes, or nested nodes. Within the world there are various regions - these might be nodes. Within those regional nodes are towns, dungeons, and other locations that would appear on a regional map. Within a town node, there may be a dozen or more points of interest in the town, which again, we can model as nodes. Within a dungeon node there are multiple rooms.

  <figcaption style="display:table-caption; caption-side:bottom; text-align:center;">Image 3. An example of an overland map, with hexes as nodes.</figcaption>
</figure>

We can break this up into four standard layers of gameplay: the overland layer, the town layer, the dungeon layer, and the scene layer (which could be combat, social, investigation, or more). While there are certainly other layers that can be used in different situations, this set of 4 will cover your classic fantasy RPG adventure. Each of these layers varies in the level of abstraction that is desired. During overland travel, tracking what action is taken every 10 minutes would quickly become tedious. However, during the resolution of a combat scene, we want to track what action is taken every 6 seconds!

Each of these layers of gameplay requires a different process as a GM, typically with a different time scale and a different focus. The decision points we care about when travelling through a massive wilderness are very different from those in a town, which are also very different from those in a dungeon. The time scale that we care about differs as well. For overland travel, for example, player turns are 4 hours in my game. In dungeons, player turns are 10 minutes. In combat, 6 seconds.

When running a session, you will be jumping between these layers, and not always in order. You might roll a random encounter during overland travel and immediately jump to the resolution of a combat scene. To handle this you must understand when you are switching layers, and switch your process to match the new layer.

## Gameplay Processes

For each of the layers discussed above, I will be diving into the process of actually running gameplay when within that layer. For most layers, there are multiple processes that can be used. A game focused on wilderness exploration will use a more granular process for gameplay on the overland layer. A game telling a linear narrative may heavily abstract all layers besides the scene layer. The layers that I plan to cover are listed below:

* **Scene Layer:** Scenes might be combat, social, investigating a room, or much more. There are many types of scenes, with different processes for resolution, but I’ll discuss some of the common ones.
* **Dungeon Layer:** Dungeons are structures with keyed nodes that are tightly connected. Dungeons are dangerous and densely populated with scenes. Most dungeons can be run using a single process.
* **Town Layer:** Towns typically have a few points of interest that can be moved between in a short time frame. Towns are usually not completely keyed, as a dungeon is. Towns are generally safe. In situations where towns are not safe, they are usually run very differently, so the process at this level can vary a bit. Regardless of safety, we require a slightly fuzzier level of resolution at the town layer than we do in the dungeon layer.
* **Overland Layer:** The overland layer typically involves travel between points of interest separated by wilderness, which is often dangerous. The resolution of overland travel can vary wildly, depending on how much your campaign revolves around exploring the wilderness. For many campaigns, overland travel can simply distract from the adventure, and they treat points of interest on the overland layer as a tightly-connected node map. For sandbox or otherwise more exploratory campaigns, overland travel will benefit from a more granular process.

In follow-up articles I’ll explore each of these gameplay layers and, perhaps most importantly, how to actually run them.
