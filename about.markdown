I'm Ryan. This is a blog.

I'm enchanted with exploring the vast unknown, and tabletop gaming is one way to do that. I'm writing about game structures in tabletop RPGs which provide consistently fun experiences at the table while minimizing the one-off work I need to do as a game master. I also write about games I'm playing, games I'm making, and world-building for games I'm running.

In 2016 I started CritterDB, a site for DMs to create custom monsters for 5th edition. Check it out: [https://critterdb.com/](https://critterdb.com/).

Personally, I live in Seattle, in the US of A, and enjoy exploration of all sorts. In my free time you'll find me in the mountains or in imaginary worlds of my own creation.
